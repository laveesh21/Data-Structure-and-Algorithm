## Vectors
`emplace_back` is a funtion which is faster than `push_back`.
We can declare `vectot<int> v(5, 100)` , it will have 5 instances of 100. 

#### Iterator
`vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin`
`it` will return address of first element


## Set
 Follow 2 principle: Sorted and Unique 
 We can use `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` in sets but not in unorderd_set.

 ## Map
 It stores everything in key : value pair.
